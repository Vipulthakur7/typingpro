💎 Unique Features (Make it stand out)
Here are some cool and unique ideas you can add:

1️⃣ 🎯 Adaptive Difficulty
Start easy with small words.

Increase difficulty automatically as WPM rises (longer words, rare words).

2️⃣ 📝 Custom Text Mode
Allow users to paste their own text or upload a text file to practice on content they like (e.g., coding syntax, poems, etc.).

3️⃣ 👨‍💻 Code Typing Mode
Provide snippets of real code (JavaScript, Python, etc.) for programmers to practice typing code efficiently.

4️⃣ 🎵 Typing with Sound Effects
Play a subtle keyboard “click” sound for each keypress.

Add background music option (LoFi or focus sounds).

5️⃣ 📊 Progress Tracker
Save scores (WPM, accuracy, date) in browser localStorage.

Show a progress chart over time (using Chart.js).

6️⃣ 🌐 Multiplayer Challenge (Advanced)
Users can send a link to friends → real-time typing race.

See opponent’s progress bar as they type.

7️⃣ 📦 Mini Games
Typing Bomb: Type words fast to defuse a bomb.

Typing Rain: Words fall from the top, type them before they hit the bottom.

8️⃣ 🖋️ Theme Customizer
Light/Dark mode.

Retro “terminal style” or modern glassmorphism design.

🛠 Tech Stack (Replit Friendly)
🖥️ Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

🪞 Optional Framework: React.js (for clean state management)

📦 Data Storage: localStorage (for progress)

📊 Charts: Chart.js (optional)

🎧 Sounds: Use small MP3/OGG files

🌐 Multiplayer (Advanced): Node.js + Socket.io

📅 Step-by-Step Roadmap
Phase 1: Core Typing App
HTML Layout

Header: “Typing Speed Test”

Text Display Area

Input Box

Timer + WPM + Accuracy display

Reset Button

CSS Styling

Clean and minimal.

Highlight current character (green if correct, red if wrong).

Optional: Glassmorphism or retro terminal theme.

JS Logic

Load a random text.

Start timer on first keypress.

Compare typed input with the original text in real-time.

Calculate:

Words Per Minute = (correct words / time) * 60

Accuracy = (correct chars / total chars) * 100

Show results after completion.

Reset button clears everything.

Phase 2: Unique Features
✅ Custom Text Mode – Add a textarea for users to input their own text.
✅ Progress Tracker – Save scores in localStorage, show history below.
✅ Theme Switcher – Toggle light/dark mode with a button.
